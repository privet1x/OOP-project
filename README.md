### This is a README file for a Java OOP project that simulates a housing estate management system.

**Project Description:**

This program allows users to manage a housing estate with apartments and parking spaces. Users can:

* Add apartments and parking spaces
* Add people as tenants
* Rent apartments and parking spaces to tenants
* Check people in and out of apartments
* Check items in and out of parking spaces
* Renew rent for apartments and parking spaces
* Cancel rent for apartments and parking spaces
* Simulate time passing

**Functionality:**

The program utilizes various functionalities:

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with classes representing entities like `Apartment`, `ParkingPlace`, `Person`, etc.
* Inheritance: Different vehicle types like `Amphibious`, `Boat`, etc. might inherit from a base `Vehicle` class.
* Exceptions:  `ProblematicTenantException` and `TooManyThingsException` handle specific error scenarios.
* User Input: Users interact with the system through a text-based menu.

**Running the Program:**

1. Ensure you have Java installed and configured on your system.
2. Clone or download the project repository.
3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the Java source code using a command like `javac Main.java` (replace `Main.java` with your main class name if different).
5. Run the program using `java Main`.

**Example Usage:**

The program presents a menu with various options for managing the housing estate. Users can choose options to simulate different scenarios. The provided code demonstrates examples like renting apartments, checking in tenants, handling problematic tenants, and saving estate statuses.

**Further Development:**

This is a basic example. You can extend functionality by:

* Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of a text-based menu.
* Adding functionalities like maintenance requests, managing utilities, and generating reports.
* Persisting data to a database instead of just in-memory storage.
